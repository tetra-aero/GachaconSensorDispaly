# Fix Naming and Spelling Issues in gachacon_driver.py

## Issue Description
The gachacon_driver.py contains several spelling errors and inconsistent naming conventions that could lead to confusion.

## Problems Identified
- `State.Discharge_Intermidiate` is misspelled (should be "Intermediate")
- `State.Stanby` is misspelled (should be "Standby")
- Inconsistent naming conventions across the codebase

## Proposed Improvements
- Correct all spelling errors in enum definitions and variable names
- Establish and apply consistent naming conventions throughout the code
- Review and update variable names to be more descriptive of their purpose

## Technical Details
The State enum is particularly important as it defines the core states of the system. Misspellings here could cause confusion when referencing states in documentation or when new developers join the project.

Example corrections:
```python
class State(Enum):
    Standby = 0                    # (currently "Stanby")
    # ... other states ...
    Discharge_Intermediate = 11    # (currently "Discharge_Intermidiate")
```

## Priority
Low to Medium

## Impact
While these issues don't affect functionality directly, correcting them will improve code readability and prevent confusion, especially for new developers joining the project.
