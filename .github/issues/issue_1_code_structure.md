# Improve Code Structure and Organization in gachacon_driver.py

## Issue Description
The current implementation of gachacon_driver.py has structural issues that make it difficult to maintain and extend.

## Problems Identified
- The entire functionality is implemented in a single, monolithic while loop with no function decomposition
- No docstring or module-level documentation explaining the overall purpose
- Missing comments for important CAN ID definitions and data structures

## Proposed Improvements
- Break down the monolithic loop into logical functions
- Create a proper class structure with clear responsibilities
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Implement a proper state machine pattern for state transitions
- Document CAN ID mappings and their purposes

## Technical Details
The current file structure uses a single large while loop to handle all functionality including:
- CAN message reception
- Data parsing and conversion
- State management
- Output generation (JSON)
- CAN message transmission for device control

This should be refactored into a proper class with methods for each responsibility area.

## Priority
Medium

## Impact
Improving code structure will make the code more maintainable, easier to understand for new developers, and reduce the risk of introducing bugs during future changes.
