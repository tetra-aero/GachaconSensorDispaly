# Code Cleanup in gachacon_driver.py

## Issue Description
The gachacon_driver.py script contains commented-out code, inconsistent formatting, and would benefit from modern Python features like type hints.

## Problems Identified
- Commented out code sections that should be cleaned up
- Excessive print statements for debugging
- Inconsistent code formatting and indentation
- Missing type hints that would improve code clarity
- Inconsistent commenting style

## Proposed Improvements
- Remove commented-out code that's no longer needed
- Standardize formatting and style (consider using a tool like Black)
- Add proper type hints throughout the code
- Implement consistent docstrings (preferably in a standard format like Google style)
- Replace debug print statements with proper logging

## Technical Details
Example with type hints and improved formatting:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Union
import can
from enum import Enum

class State(Enum):
    """System operation states."""
    Standby = 0
    # ... other states ...

def process_can_message(msg: can.Message) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Process a CAN message and convert it to a dictionary.
    
    Args:
        msg: The CAN message to process
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with CAN ID as key and data as value
    """
    result = {}
    if not msg:
        return result
        
    tmp = " ".join(format(msg.data[i], '02X') for i in range(msg.dlc))
    result[f"0x{msg.arbitration_id:04X}"] = tmp
    return result
```

## Priority
Low to Medium

## Impact
Code cleanup will:
- Improve code readability
- Make maintenance easier
- Help new developers understand the code
- Reduce technical debt
- Make future refactoring safer through better type checking
